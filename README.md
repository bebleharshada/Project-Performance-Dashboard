Project Performance Dashboard - Cost, Risk & Progress Overview
1. Project Title / Headline üöÄ

Project Performance Dashboard - Cost, Risk & Progress Overview - A comprehensive, interactive Power BI visualization tool built to monitor and analyze project management KPIs ‚Äî focusing on budget vs actual cost tracking, completion percentage monitoring, delay analysis, and risk assessment for strategic project oversight and decision-making.

2. Short Description / Purpose

The Project Performance Dashboard is a visually engaging and analytical Power BI report designed to help project managers, stakeholders, and executives track key project metrics in real-time. It highlights critical performance indicators such as budget allocation vs actual costs, project completion percentages, timeline delays, revenue tracking, and risk level assessment across multiple projects. This tool empowers project management teams to make data-driven decisions for better resource allocation, timeline management, and risk mitigation.

3. Tech Stack

The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies: üîß Power BI Desktop ‚Äì Main data visualization platform used for report creation and interactive filtering. üìä Power Query ‚Äì Data transformation and cleaning processes for project data preparation. üìà DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) ‚Äì Used for calculated measures, completion percentages, delay calculations, budget variance analysis, and conditional logic. üóÉÔ∏è Data Modeling ‚Äì Relationships established among tables (projects, budgets, timelines, resources, risk assessments) to enable cross-filtering and comprehensive analysis. üéØ Interactive Filters ‚Äì Dynamic filter panel with Service Type, Project Name, and Risk Level selections. üìã File Format ‚Äì .pbix for development and .pdf for dashboard and report previews.

4. Data Source

Source: Sample dataset. Data includes project information, budget allocations, actual costs, timeline schedules, completion percentages, delay tracking, revenue data, risk assessments, and resource assignments across multiple concurrent projects.

5. Features / Highlights

Business Problem: Organizations often struggle with project visibility and lack unified platforms to monitor project performance, track budget utilization, assess completion rates, and identify potential risks, leading to cost overruns, timeline delays, and poor resource allocation.
Goal of the Dashboard: To provide a single, interactive platform for project management teams to monitor project health, track financial performance, analyze completion trends, identify delays, and assess risk levels across the entire project portfolio.
